### Online Editors


#### LaTeX


1. [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/): Dropbox integration, preview, cooperation.
2. [WriteLaTeX](https://www.writelatex.com/)
3. [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)


You can host one using your own machine,

1. [FlyLaTeX](https://github.com/alabid/flylatex): A free, open source version of sharelatex
2. [ShareLaTeX Source Code](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex): ShareLaTeX open sourced their codes. This is a great move I would say.

> 1. [StackEdit](http://stackedit.io): Markdown + Math
> 2. [JaxEdit](http://jaxedit.com/): JaxEdit is not exactly an online LaTeX editor but anyway it uses mathjax to render math.
