### Editors

Markdown, restructuredText and LaTeX are the three languages that I recommend to use.


#### Markdown

1. [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)(`Cloud`): Markdown and MathJax
2. [CMD markdown](https://www.zybuluo.com/mdeditor)(`Cloud`): Basically a Chinese copy of StackEdit
3. [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/)(`Cloud`): Markdown based and git like.
4. [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)(`Cloud`): A much more powerful markdown editor that can be used to produce nice academic papers.
5. [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)(`Cloud`): Markdown editor but no math mode.
6. [Online Kramdown Editor](http://kramdown.herokuapp.com/)(`Cloud`)
7. [Pandoc Markdown](http://pandoc.herokuapp.com/)(`Cloud`)
8. [JaxEdit](http://jaxedit.com/)(`Cloud`): JaxEdit is not exactly an online LaTeX editor but anyway it uses mathjax to render math.
9. [Marxico](http://marxi.co/)(`Cloud`): markdown that integrates with Evernote. [马克飞象](http://maxiang.info/)(`Cloud`) is the chinese version。


#### LaTeX


1. [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)(`Cloud`): Dropbox and GitHub integration, preview, cooperation, simple UI. It also provides a lot of templates.
2. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)(`Cloud`): Basically the same as ShareLaTeX. `Tell me more about it if you `
3. [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)(`Cloud`)


You can host one using your own machine,

1. [FlyLaTeX](https://github.com/alabid/flylatex): A free, open source version of sharelatex
2. [ShareLaTeX Source Code](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex): ShareLaTeX open sourced their codes. This is a great move I would say.


> There are other editors that is not fully LaTeX somehow partially support LaTeX.

> 1. [StackEdit](http://stackedit.io): Markdown + Math
> 2. [JaxEdit](http://jaxedit.com/): JaxEdit is not exactly an online LaTeX editor but anyway it uses mathjax to render math.
> 3. [马克飞象](http://maxiang.info/) 和 [Marxico](http://marxi.co/) 是 evernote 的 MD 编辑器。

### Keep The Notes

It's alway better to keep track the changes of your notes thus git is a nice choice to keep the notes. GitHub is the almost perfect place. (More about organizing your stuff in [Be Organized](be-organized.html) section.)



Some softwares allows you to keep the markdown notes on a server.

* [Raneto](http://raneto.com/): Raneto is an open source Knowledgebase platform that uses static Markdown files to power your Knowledgebase. This one has a nice looking.
* [Realms](http://realms.io/): Git based wiki written in Python Inspired by Gollum, Ghost, and Dillinger. Basic authentication and registration included.
* [Tiddlywiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/): A unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.
